- "the risk to one’s privacy should not substantially (as bounded by ε) increase as a result of participating in a statistical database."
- need to add noise to results of queries; various mechanisms available
- identifying a unique row violates privacy
- "The Laplace mechanism involves adding random noise that conforms to the Laplace statistical distribution. That’s it"
- We are not guaranteed unlimited privacy, but rather a "privacy budget." Limit number of queries so users cannot be compromised.
- Sensitivity of a database = maximum difference between two queries on databases that differ by only one row
- Privacy parameter - related directly to accuracy of queries and inversely to privacy

MY PROPOSAL:
Create a database with several pieces of information that could be exploited, like the "Mr. Smith moves out" scenario in
the one article. Add noise according to at least two different mechanisms. Make malicious queries and observe:

- Privacy gain from adding the noise
- Any differences between results from the two mechanisms
- Need for a limit on number of queries
- Whether DP is better at preventing some tracker attacks than others
- etc
